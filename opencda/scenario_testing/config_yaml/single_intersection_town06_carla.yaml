  Content: This is the scenario testing configuration file for single vehicle perception/localization/behavior/control
           testing in high speed in the customized 2lanefree simple version.

# First define the basic parameters of the vehicles
vehicle_base:
  sensing:
    perception:
      camera:
        visualize: 0
        num: 0 # how many cameras are mounted on the vehicle. Maximum 3(frontal, left and right cameras)
        # relative positions (x,y,z,yaw) of the camera. len(positions) should be equal to camera num
        positions: []
  behavior:
    max_speed: 50 # maximum speed, km/h
    ignore_traffic_light: false # whether to ignore traffic light
    collision_time_ahead: 2.0 # used for collision checking

# define the background traffic control by carla
carla_traffic_manager:
  random: true # whether to random select vehicles' color and model
  global_speed_perc: 0
  vehicle_list: ~  # a number or a list
  # Used only when vehicle_list is a number.
  # x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max, x_step, y_step, veh_num
  range:
    - [ 2, 10, 0, 200, 3.5, 25, 30]

# define scenario. In this scenario, a 4-vehicle platoon already exists.
scenario:
  single_cav_list: # this is for merging vehicle or single cav without v2x
