  Content: This is the scenario testing configuration file for single vehicle perception/localization/behavior/control
           testing in high speed in the customized 2lanefree simple version.

# First define the basic parameters of the vehicles
vehicle_base:
  sensing:
    perception:
      camera:
        visualize: 0
        num: 0 # how many cameras are mounted on the vehicle. Maximum 3(frontal, left and right cameras)
        # relative positions (x,y,z,yaw) of the camera. len(positions) should be equal to camera num
        positions: []
  behavior:
    max_speed: 70 # maximum speed, km/h
    safety_time: 4 # ttc safety thresholding for decreasing speed
    ignore_traffic_light: true # whether to ignore traffic light
    collision_time_ahead: 1.5 # used for collision checking
    overtake_allowed: false # whether overtake allowed, typically false for platoon leader
    
# define the background traffic control by carla
carla_traffic_manager:
  random: true # whether to random select vehicles' color and model
  global_speed_perc: 0
  ignore_lights_percentage: 100 # whether set the traffic ignore traffic lights
  ignore_signs_percentage: 100 # whether the cars will ignore stop signs
  vehicle_list: ~  # a number or a list
  # Used only when vehicle_list is a number.
  # x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max, x_step, y_step, veh_num
  range:
    - [ 450, 520, -100, -10, 15, 3, 18]

# define scenario. In this scenario, a 4-vehicle platoon already exists.
